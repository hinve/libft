# Libft ->The first 42 cursus project <-
**Libft** is a project from 42 schools that involves creating a library in **C**.
The main objective is to replicate a bunch of existing functions developed by yourself, as well as additional functions that will be very useful throughout the course. In addition to creating the functions, I learned how to create **libraries** and how to use **Makefile**.
## Features
- Implementation of standard C functions like strlen, atoi, memset, among others.
- Additional useful functions such as linked list handling, memory manipulation, and other utilities.
- Creation and use of a Makefile to compile the library efficiently.
## Estructura del proyecto
```
libft/
├── ft_*.c            # Implementation of the functions.
├── libft.h           # Library.
└── Makefile          # Compilation scripts.
```
## Usage
To use the library in your own project:
1. Clone the repository to your machine
   ```
   $ git clone https://github.com/hinve/libft.git
   $ cd libft
   ```
2. Compile the **library**
   ```
   $ make
   ```
3. Include the library in your project by linking it during compilation. Make sure to include the **libft.h** header file in the files of your project where you need the library functions.
## Contributions
This project is mainly for my personal learning, but if you have any suggestions or improvements, feel free to contact me about it :).
